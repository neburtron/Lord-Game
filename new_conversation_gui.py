Thing that calls the new conversation.py rewrite. 

Figure out some sort of GUI whenever I get around to it. 



How this should work

static backdrop
Text chat in center of screen overlayed semi-transparent over backdrop
Input text box at bottom
Buttons under that
settings menu top right
Stats in bottom left - like sort the court
Footer at bottom of screen with a few buttions on it
