## How to contribute


### Read this stuff first

#### General stuff

If you're doing a pull request, please go through what you changed, it makes it easier for me and it's not that much more effort. If you make it easier for me in this regard it'll make it easier for me to work on the game more and everyone wins. Also try and write good, clear code with comments and try to match style if you want your stuff merged in. Thanks.

#### About the Licence + Copyright
This is an open-source project that uses the Unlicense. If you're contributing to this project you're working to improve this public domain program. if you don't want to, I think forking it lets you change the license, you can make your own thing inspired by this thing / use it as a starting point, or you can make a mod of some sort where you maintain the rights to your stuff as a separate thing. If you want to make your own thing + keep the copyright, I've got no problem with it, my offer to link to your stuff + whatever else still stands. I'm making it public domain for your sake, if you don't agree with me about copyright so be it. recognizing this is a condition to contribute. I'm not gonna ask you about it because this is the second section in the how to contribute section and I've made no secret that this is a public domain project.



### Try it out first...
First off, if you haven't already, try out the current prototype. then if you feel like reading, having a look at the readme is also a good idea, because there I talk a lot about what the game is, how it works on a fundamental level, and where I want to go with it.


### Do what you'd like
If you want to do something for this project, go ahead. If I don't think it fits with where I want the game to be, I might not accept a merge request. However, this is a completely public domain property and I am 200% open to mods, you developing your own take on things, or anything else, this is not mine, it's public domain, do what you will. I'd love to hear about it + link to your stuff on here if you're building it off of what I made. 

That said, I will accept help. If you want to help and for me to give you stuff to do, reach out. Otherwise, I try and indicate what the code I write does, and what I plan on doing in the future, so if you just want to fix things yourself go ahead.


### What I'm Looking for

If you want some ideas as to what to start with, here's some stuff!

#### Patch or Report Bugs

If you find a bug and want to fix it, go ahead. Also, report it or whatever if you don't feel like patching it. I think the way you normally do that is the issues tab, and you should be able to do that.

#### Improve Code

I am not the best at coding. If you can make it cleaner, more effective, and easier to expand upon, yeah, that'd be great! If you are doing this though, I'd ask you to write out what you did to improve it, because I'm not the one who coded your fixes and it'd help evaluate it.

#### Add or Improve Features

Heck yeah! Tell me about what you're thinking of doing, I'd like to hear about it and tell you how likely I am to add whatever you make to the project. It'd also be useful for me as I develop what I happen to develop, so we don't tread the same ground, without you intentionally making your own version of the game. Later on, this policy may change, as of writing this it's just me, but that might not always be the case.

#### Ideas / Brainstorm

If you've got ideas share them. I can manage stuff in the discussions section if you need that, you can contact me directly, and you could mail them to your local representatives. They might not know how to get it to me or care to, but you could still do it.

#### Format Stuff

Listen, I'm new to GitHub and coding. tell me what I'm doing wrong please or like do it yourself and do a git pull. Thanks, sorry, thank you again. I'm trying to do this right, I've spent all day writing a better Readme + this doc, and there's other non-code, writing for the people who look at my thing stuff I should be focusing on.

##### Contact me

If you want to contact me, my email's mutemaroonworm@gmail.com, you can contact me through GitHub I think, I can use other platforms too, but you got this file from GitHub, everyone has an email, contact me through one of these means, if you want to move to another platform sure. Also, I created my account as neburtron, but I changed the name to MuteMar, yeah.

I'm cool to answer questions or whatever else.
