If you're going to help with something try and implement whatever you're implementing well, and finish whatever you're making before trying to get it added. I can do it because I'm cool.

I don't know how github works. If you want to contribute and can't because I didn't set something up / have it so you can't tell me. 

Also say what you're changing / fixing.
