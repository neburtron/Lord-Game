This is more of a planning doc. I'm working on this because I want an LLM based game, if anyone else wants to help... Sure. As it says on my DeviantArt page (MuteMar) everything I make is, unless stated otherwise, public domain. 

Events + decision prompts refer to the same thing

Now, on to the more interesting bit.

The game is rather simple in concept, but I haven't fully worked out the implementation. 

There are 5 or 6 values that tether the game to some sort of structure
These values change based on the users decisions
This happens in the form of 3 "commands" the LLM can call:
	Change now
	Change same way for X turns
	Change after X turns
These changes have a name, desc, set of turns, and a list for the values changed and by what amount
- later potentially have other stop conditions + giving the LLM the ability to stop previously started change same way for x turns or change after x turns


First turn
Player given a what king do you want to be monologue, then the llm makes a change same way based on their response (but this one doesn't have a turn limit)

After that the game actually starts with a set of pre-written decision prompts

The LLM through commands decides what happens to the values after every decision prompt

After the turn is over several things happen and this part isn't the most mapped out.
There's gotta be some data saved about the world, so that's collected / updated
Sown seeds are collected, storylines are formed, or followup things are decided on
The decision prompts list is repopulated with the starting list as reference for the style, alongside other data

More complexity might be added later, I like aging as a thing in theory, I like seasons, named characters and lore has to be a thing and I don't know how that's best tackled, yeah. 

Other stuff's probably in my head, but I don't know what I haven't said.


What's Next for development:

I'm going to fix the prompts, I wrote some stuff, but I was planning to have the descriptions of prompts and have the llm expand them so it doesn't need to do the characterization / style at the same time as the content, but you don't really need that long of a decision prompt and at the very least I need the first turn's worth to show it what style it should be writing in.

Then I'll probably do a temp terminal chat thing and get a script together that puts all the text in an array for the LLM.

From there I'm not sure, but I told you what the goal is, this is a proof of concept, I'm going to try and get it working first and foremost because I don't know how to code and that's the whole idea for this project.
