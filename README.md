# Lord Game Rewrite

not done yet

This is a project I've been thinking about for a while.

Sort the court but with LLMs. This isn't a replace writers type thing, Fuck anyone who thinks getting rid of writers is a good idea. This is a different type of game. Where Sort the Court is about the story, this game is more about specific decisionmaking and player lead stuff. Games are an interactive medium and this is my attempt at a less telltale, more rimworld / DF type game. 

Sort the Court Devs, I just want to say, big fan of your stuff, you made a great game and this doesn't come across as an insult, your work is great, even though I exhausted the story I've revisited the game so many times, multiple times this year, it really is great, AI doesn't exist and ChatGPT is a glorified word guesser, I just want to boss computer people around, don't be mad at me plz.


Just go to Call_LLM.py and put your details in if you want to play with this, you can host an LLM locally if you find an app that mimics the OpenAI API, I know LM Studio does, but I don't know if they're trustworthy, that's just what I use.

All I've made so far is the call LLM script, it's not a game yet, don't download it.
