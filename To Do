temp file, ignore this, I'm going to put this stuff somewhere else + delete it in the next commit

Make importable script for commonly run commands
- ex. write file

Write new start LLM script

Add notes to TempTerminal relay command, only LLM should see, don't print.

Get Values command for Values.py + whatever they're saved in

Create new save - I've got a prevous draft of this project + I might take this from that. 

Next_Turn.py

I don't know if I need to do anything about dependencies / what. 
You need to import openai for this to work, I don't remember if there's any others.

Make TempTerminal get LLM start prompt from txt file or something
